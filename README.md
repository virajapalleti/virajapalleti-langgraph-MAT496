## INSIGHTS:

## **Module01:**

_Lesson02: Simple Graphs_  
Built a basic LangGraph workflow demonstrating conditional branching - the foundation of decision-making in graphs.

- State (similar to a dictionary)= obj e pass between nodes and edges of a graph
- Learnt Graph construction and node definition
- Conditional edges for branching logic and then Graph visualisation  
  Made my own graph implementation with 5 nodes with probability fo 0.25 each for choosing my favourite f1 driver.
